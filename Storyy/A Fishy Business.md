...

One day, I woke up from my sleep and wanted to get off from my bed. To my horror, I could not feel my legs. I looked down, and widened my eyes in 
shock.

My legs.

My legs were gone.

I wasn't even on my bed.

I swam towards the glass to take a look at myself.

Wait.

Swam?

What glass?

...

"Hey! You're up! How's my champ doing this morning?" I turned around and saw another goldfish a little bigger than me. I could recognise that specific fish. It was Rodney, one of my **pet fish**. "Um, hi?" I responded. "Why's my son sounding different this morning? Probably lack of sleep haha. Anyways, go wake ur family up, the *big faces* are coming soon." Big faces? **Son**? Man, this is so messed up. I assumed that my "family" are my other pet fish. I swam to the mini pineapple from spongebob that I had bought for my fish and as expected, the rest of my "family" were inside. Ugh, they looked so creepy with their eyes open. "Er, guys? Wake up. The big faces are coming." Immediately, everyone woke up with a jolt and rushed out of the pineapple. I could hear some of them screaming, "AHHHH THE *BIG FACES* ARE COMING GET INTO POSITION GUYS!" I could hear a voice shushing them and telling them to calm down. "Ooooo, it's nom nom time!" a squeaky small voice said. What's the big deal with big faces? What are they anyway? Then, the door of my bedroom creeked open, and I finally got a glimpse of the *big faces*.

Slowly, I saw the first *big face* looming towards me. I tried to blink several times, but realised that I had no eyelids. It's Dad? The whole entourage zoomed to the surface with their mouths opening and closing in robotic unison. My dad took the container of fish food and screwed open the lid. "Pffft, ew! What's that smell? Blood worms? Ugh, I am not eating breakfast." I swam back to the pineapple to rest.

As I floated in the pineapple, a traumatising thought struck me. 

Rodney, *big faces*, blood worms.

I was...a goldfish?

No time to think. Another big face appeared in front of me. It's... oh wait no. NO! IT CAN'T BE!

Staring at me, was myself. Or my human form, at least.
